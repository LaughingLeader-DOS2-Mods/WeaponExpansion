# 1.0 Update 

**The 1.0 update is a work-in-progress, and is not yet ready for release.**  

This is a complete rewrite of all of the scripts, many of which existed since 2018 (before the Script Extender existed). Additionally, the remainaing mastery ranks are being filled out, and a few new uniques are being added.

This repository is for tracking changes to the textual files, and is not a direct mirror of the mod, as many binary files have changed, and these aren't tracked by git.  

Please be patient as the update is being worked on. Thanks.
